# How-To Guides

## Configuring a JupyterLite deployment

A JupyterLite website can be configured in many ways, and reuse many of the existing
tools and extensions from the Jupyter ecosystem.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

configure/extensions
configure/hard
```

## Configuring the Python environment

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

python/packages
```

## Extensions

JupyterLite uses the same extension system as in JupyterLab, and can be extended to add
more features and plugins, such as frontend extensions and new kernels.

```{toctree}
:maxdepth: 1

extensions/frontend
extensions/server
extensions/kernel
```
